Using Unity 2017.2.1p2 and the most recent version of Vuforia, which is included with Unity. 

It basically uses certain spaces of the physical target as a button, where the user can click to do basically any action that is posible in Unity. (Play animations, change colors, move an object, etcetera)

Most of the instructions are within scriptTeste.cs, it's use is pretty simple overall and I believe it can be used for a bunch of other practical applications. The .unitypackage with the Vuforia target is located insite the project folder too. With this, you should have a basic knowledge of how it works, and hopefully you have a nice example of how to work with Virtual Buttons.

I'll update a video of it working soon. 

Thanks for stopping by!
